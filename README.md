# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this project was to create a webpage that has study materials for future use in this course. 
I built this project as a way to practice HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.
This project solved the problem of learning the basics to webpage development and how to create our own studyguide.
I learned how to navigate the terminal, basic HTML, basic CSS, basic JavaScript, and basic git commands.
